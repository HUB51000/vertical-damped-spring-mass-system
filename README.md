# vertical-dampened-spring-mass-system
Plot of displacement, velocity and acceleration versus time graph for a vertical, dampened single spring, single mass system in MATLAB. Assume, (All of the folowing constants are in SI units)

acceleration due to gravity(g) = 9.81 m/s^2  
mass = 1 kg  
spring constant = 5g N/m   
damping coefficient = 1 s^-1   
initial extension given to the mass = 4*Xo meters   
where, Xo is the extension of the spring when the system is left undisturbed.
